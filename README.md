# CA3 Model

Initial code translation for a light-color resource competition model for phytoplankton in red-green aquatic environments based on equations and theory published by [Stomp et al., 2008](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/591680)

Competition is between light-color absorption specialist phytoplankton with maximum absorption at 580 nm (green-specialist) and 620 nm (red-specialist). The generalist strain undergoes Type III Chromatic Acclimation (CA3) and changes the ratio of photosynthetic pigments phycoerythrin (PE) to phycocyanin (PC) under red and green light. PE:PC goes up in green light, and down in red light.
