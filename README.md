# CA3 Model

A light-color resource competition model for phytoplankton in red-green aquatic environments.

Competition is between specialist phytoplankton that absorb red or green light, and generalists phytoplankton that undergo Type III Chromatic Acclimation (CA3) and change photosynthetic pigments to absorb either green or red light.

The biology involves changing the ratio of phycoerythrin (green-absorbing) to phycocyanin (red-absorbing) in the phycobilisome light-harvesting antenna of the phytoplankton cell.  

Model code is based on equations and theory published by [Stomp et al., 2008](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/591680)
